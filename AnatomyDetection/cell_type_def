# This annotation of cell type markers is tailored for surface proteins
# normally profilid with multiplexed imaging (IMC, CODEX).
# It is a simple reference for myself and may be more detailed in some parts than others.
# This reference is hierarchical.
# This annotation is generally pan-tissue.

                        - regulates host defense to viruses and other intracellular pathogens and promotes CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.
                        - promote tumor rejection given their specialization in recognition of dead and dying cells, cross-presentation and ability to drive CD8 + T-cell response.

                        - specialized for anti-viral responses and are an important source of IFN-I (and IFN-III) upon viral infection.
                        - pDC are considered to have a similar role in potentiating anti-tumoral immune responses via IFN-I production, however, pDC may also drive tolerance and immune suppression in the context of malignancy.
                        - While pDC are able to cross-present antigen to prime CD8 + T-cells, they exhibit inferior cross-presenting capacity relative to their conventional DC counterparts.

                        - highly context-dependent DC subset that differentiate in response to inflammatory stimuli and are recruited to sites of inflammation, including the TME, via the CCR2-CCL2 chemokine signaling axis.
                        - MoDC are heterogeneous and share substantial overlap with certain cDC2 subsets and monocytes, which is reflected in the diverse range of immune actions initiated by MoDC.

                        - share overlapping phenotypic features with conventional DC, including both cDC1 and cDC2, yet harbor a distinct transcriptional profile.
                        - DC3 program is signified by the co-existence maturation/activation markers and an immunoregulatory profile that includes markers of DC migration, DC maturation, immune-regulation.
